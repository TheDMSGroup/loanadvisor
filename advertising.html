        <h1>Advertising Disclosure</h1>
        <p>All credit decisions are made by the lenders. The personal loan products on LoanAdvisor.com are from companies from which LoanAdvisor.com may receive compensation. Compensation may impact where products appear on the site (including the order in which they appear). LoanAdvisor.com does not include all personal loan companies or all types of products available in the marketplace.
        <p>As of 6/12/2017, visitors to LoanAdvisor.com were seeing match rates as low as 4.99% (4.99% APR) on a $5,000 loan amount for a term of three (3) years. This loan rate is based on the following self-reported criteria: a borrower with excellent credit, zero down payment, origination fees of $0 to $100 (depending on the loan amount and term selected).Rates and APR and other terms you may be offered may vary from this example based on your state, credit history, credit score, financial situation, loan amount, loan term, loan usage and other underwriting criteria of the lenders. Lenders generally have a range of available APRs and only borrowers with excellent credit will qualify for the lower rates. There is a possibility you may not be matched with any lenders. Loans are not available in all states at all requested amounts. LoanAdvisor.com only matches you with potential lenders and your inquiry on this website does not constitute a loan application.</p>
